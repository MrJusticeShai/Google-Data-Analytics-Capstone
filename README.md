# *PREPARE*

## Dataset :
* The data set is publicly available on [divvy-tripdata](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) , index of bucket.
* The data has been made available by
Motivate International Inc, a third party company.
* Data Collected include :
   1. ride_id,
   2. rideable_type
   3. started_at
   4. ended_at
   5. start_station_name
   6. start_station_id
   7. end_startion_name
   8. end_station_id
   9. member_causal (membership type)
* Data was downloaded according to the [data licence agreement](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

## Dataset Limitations :
1. Data used was collected from Q1 and Q2 of 2021. User's bike share and usage activity may have changed since then, perhaps influenced by external factors.
2. As per the data licence agreement, Divvy system data agreed with the Cuty of Chicago to only make the certain data owned by the City available to the public, hence some parameters may be missed which could affect the accuracy of our analysis.

## Is Data ROCCC? :
A reliable dataset or data-source should ROCCC which is an abbriviation for **R**eliable, **O**riginal, **C**omprehensive, **C**urrent, and **C**ited.
 1. Reliable - HIGH - Reliable as the data comes from the secondary data source, which would be DivvyBikes (which happens to be a reliable data source)
 2. Original - MEDIUM - Second party data source (DivvyBikes Data)
 3. Comprehensive - HIGH - Parameters match Cyclistic Bike-Share inventory parameters
 4. Current - HIGH - Data is from 2021's first and second quarter
 5. Cited - MEDIUM - Data collected from second party, hence a fair level of uncertainty is observed and expected.

The dataset is good quality data, and is recommended to produce business recommendations based on the insights drawn from it.

## Data Selection :
The following files are selected and copied for analysis.
 * 202101-divvy-tripdata

Using R to process, transform and process the data.

## Environment Setup :
Import packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(skimr)
library(dplyr)
```


## Load or Import Datasets :
Reading required CSV files
```{r}
jan_2021 <- read.csv("202101-divvy-tripdata.csv")
feb_2021 <- read.csv("202102-divvy-tripdata.csv")
mar_2021 <- read.csv("202103-divvy-tripdata.csv")
apr_2021 <- read.csv("202104-divvy-tripdata.csv")
may_2021 <- read.csv("202105-divvy-tripdata.csv")
june_2021 <- read.csv("202106-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```
Merge CSV files into a single data-frame
```{r}
trips_frame <- rbind(jan_2021, feb_2021, mar_2021, apr_2021, may_2021, june_2021)
```
